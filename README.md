### Description

A revised template on the previous lay report template writen for LaTeX, 
which is a revision from the previous MS Office Word. This is aimed to be 
a document which closely resembles the previous InFoMM style, with the
content focused nature of LaTeX documents. There will likely be significant 
measures in place to make the document more visualy striking than ordinary
LaTeX documents. 

## Requirements

 * Git.
 * PdfLaTeX.

## Getting Started.

We have created a convenient bash script which will create the pdf
document, and will ensure that the figures are captioned, references
updated, etc.
